# Credit Default Risk Prediction

This project predicts the probability of credit card default using TabNet and several baseline machine learning models.

Dataset: Default of Credit Card Clients (UCI Machine Learning Repository)
Each record contains demographic and financial information about a borrower.
The target variable is `default_payment_next_month` (1 = default, 0 = non-default).

## 1. Project structure:

tabnet_application/
  default-of-credit-card-clients-predictive-models.ipynb   - Jupyter notebook for training and evaluation
  default_of_credit_card_clients.csv                       - Dataset file
  tabnet_credit_default.zip                                - Trained model file
  catboost_info/                                           - CatBoost logs and auxiliary data
  README.md                                                - This documentation

Models used:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost / CatBoost
  - TabNet (main model)

TabNet combines tree-like feature selection with neural network learning, designed for tabular structured data.

## 2. Main workflow:
1. Data preprocessing
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize numeric features
   - Encode categorical variables

2. Model training
   - Split dataset into training and test sets
   - Train models, tune hyperparameters
   - Evaluate using standard classification metrics

3. Model evaluation
   - Compare baseline models with TabNet
   - Analyze feature importance and interpretability

## 3. Requirements:
  pip install pandas numpy torch pytorch-tabnet scikit-learn matplotlib

## 4. Usage:
### 1. Prepare the environment
Make sure Python 3.8 or above is installed.

Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy torch pytorch-tabnet scikit-learn matplotlib


If you want to reproduce baseline models such as XGBoost or CatBoost:
pip install xgboost catboost

### 2. Prepare the dataset
Download or ensure the dataset file `default_of_credit_card_clients.csv` is located in the same folder as the notebook.
This dataset should have columns such as:
- `LIMIT_BAL`, `SEX`, `EDUCATION`, `MARRIAGE`, `AGE`
- `PAY_0` to `PAY_6`
- `BILL_AMT1` to `BILL_AMT6`
- `PAY_AMT1` to `PAY_AMT6`
- `default_payment_next_month` (target)

No manual cleaning is needed if you use the provided notebook.

### 3. Run the notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook file:
